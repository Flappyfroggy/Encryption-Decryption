# Frog encrypt and decrypter
A simple frog themed encryption and decryption system using python.

# Why i made it
This project was my first ever experience coding a program, and i made it in a technology class some time ago. I then joined high seas in the same year a few terms later, never having coded again, but enjoyed it, and found this little program sitting in my files. i then gave it a few small changes (finished it) to make sure it looked and functioned how i wanted it to, and published it here.
